# WaveControl

I wanted to try working with hand gestures to control certain aspect of code. I implemented first the hand recognition script. 
Then when it was working properly and I could obtain the coordinates for the index and the thumb, I wanted to be able to control something with it. I remembered the project Encounter. So I decided to replicate the animation and control the amplitude of the waves with my fingers. 

The animation part of the project is heavly inspired by this project : https://github.com/ilmenit/sizecoding/blob/main/Encounter/Encounter.md

## Evolutive

If you wanna see the full animation as intended, you can change the value of the argument *Evolutive* to True.
